    <h3 class="heading2">What is CSS?</h3>
    <ol class="oll">
        <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.</li>
        <li>CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen,paper,or in other media.</li>
        <li><b class="li3">Css is not neccesary</b> <b class="li31">CSS saves a lot of work.</b> It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once
        </li>
        <li class="li4">External stylesheets are stored in CSS file</li>
    </ol>
    <h3 class="heading2">CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways</h3>
    <ul class="ull">
        <li>Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements1</li>
        <li>Internal - by using a style element in the head section</li>
        <li>External - by using a link element to link to an external CSS file.</li>
        <li>The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the style in external CSS files. However, <b class="li31">in this <br> tutorial we
            will use inline and internal styles,</b> because this is easier to demonstrate, and easier <br> for you to try it
            yourself.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="para">When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements ID, on the other hand applies, a style to one unique element. ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element and it's used by JavaScript.</p>
    <p class="para">In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of element on a web page. Once an element has been targeted, a style or set of styles can be applied to the element.</p>
    <p class="para">There is a wide range of selectors available. Two of the most commonly used are class and ID. Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied.</p>
